  <h2 class="font-semibold mb-3">Me as a developer</h2>
  <p>
    I prefer working long-term on products rather than moving quickly between
    roles. Spending time with a product and its people allows me to contribute
    beyond code by understanding real problems, suggesting meaningful
    improvements, and helping shape better solutions.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    I focus on writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code that holds up over
    time. Throughout my career, I've worked with different technologies,
    business domains, and multilingual teams, which has given me a broad
    perspective on problem-solving and communication.
